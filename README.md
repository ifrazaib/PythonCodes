## Python Basics Project
## Overview
The Python Basics Project is a comprehensive resource designed to introduce and reinforce fundamental Python programming concepts. This project covers essential topics such as classes, lists, tuples, NumPy, Pandas, and inheritance. It is aimed at beginners who are looking to build a strong foundation in Python programming.

## Classes
In Python, classes are used to create user-defined data structures. Classes encapsulate data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) into a single entity.

## Lists
 Lists are ordered, mutable collections of items. They are one of the most versatile data structures in Python.

- Example:

## Tuples
Tuples are ordered, immutable collections of items. They are useful for grouping related data.

- Example:

## NumPy
NumPy is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and many mathematical functions.

- Example:

## Pandas
Pandas is a library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for Python. It is particularly well-suited for handling tabular data.

- Example:

## Inheritance
Inheritance is a feature of object-oriented programming that allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class.

- Example:
